== What is iRecovery? ==
iRecovery is a libusb-based command-line utility for macOS and Linux (perhaps Windows too but I'm not developing/testing under Windows). It is able to talk to the iBoot/iBSS in Apple's iPhone/iPad/iPod touch via USB.

It's completely open-source, the source-code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.
The full license text can be found in the LICENSE file.
