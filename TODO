TODO (iRecovery)
 * 1) Rewrite device_buffer so that device_upload uses it (no point in repeated code!).
 * 2) Remove unused functions and reorganise source (use headers properly).
 * 3) Convert source a library(?).
 * 4) Rewrite the major functions most of this is done in iRecovery++
 * 5) Work on a plugin system (grab ecid etc…)
 * 6) Rewrite scripting with some basic logic.
